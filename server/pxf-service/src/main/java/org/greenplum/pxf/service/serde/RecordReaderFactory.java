                    This code used to use the Text class to read bytes until a line delimiter was found. This would cause
                    issues with wide rows that had 1MB+, because the Text code grows the array to fit data, and
                    it does so inefficiently. We observed multiple calls to System.arraycopy in the setCapacity method
                    for every byte after we exceeded the original buffer size. This caused terrible performance in PXF,
                    even when writing a single row to an external system.
